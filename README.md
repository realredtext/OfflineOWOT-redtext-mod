# OfflineOWOT
my mod of offlineOWOT v3 with more features and separate pages 

Additions:

-modifiable permissions

-simulated server-side commands (whoami, stats, worlds, uptime, etc...)

-plans for other pages

-tile locking

-(partially implemented) character locking

-ability to save your world and load it later

-removed networkHTTP (relies on ajax/ links, not very offline)

-misc. changes

clone this repo then open "offlineowot_lts.html" in the pages folder to get it going
